\section{Introduction}

The third essential ingredient for robot autonomy deals with higher level decision making regarding the movement of the robot in its environment. Given a starting configuration (pose in our case), an end configuration, a representation of the environment surrounding the robot (assumed to be known for this assignment) and information about the environment from on-board sensors, the task is to define a feasible path through the environment to reach the end configuration from the start configuration without violating given constraints of the robot and its environment. The environment may be static or dynamic and the planning may exhibit different layers of abstraction. 

Aside from the global planning task for the complete path, the robot needs to react to obstacles on a local level, which is especially important for dynamic environments. This reaction is usually defined as obstacle or collision avoidance and usually employs a more accurate local planner.

\section{A* algorithm}

The A* Algorithm is a popular graph traversal path planning algorithm. It is widely used in static environments, but there are still examples where it is used in dynamic environments. This algorithm works based on the lowest cost path tree from the initial point to the final target point. \cite{Karur21}

It is simpler and less computationally-heavy than many other path planning algorithms, with its efficiency lending itself to operation on constrained and embedded systems. \cite{Karur21}
