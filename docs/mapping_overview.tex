\section{Introduction}
World models are representations of reality which help robots to localize within and interact with their environment. For successful utilization of the models they have to be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compact to be used efficiently
  \item Adapted to the task and the environment
  \item Usable in case of sensor and position uncertainty
  \end{itemize}
A map is a commonly used model of the environment and very essential in mobile robotics. Maps allow robots to localize themselves and carry out their tasks. A variety of maps can be employed and we can distinguish them by the metrics they use (continuous, discrete, topological).\par
The scope of this paper is to analyze different mapping for mobile robots with special focus on 2D motion. The task was to write about different maps and mapping algorithms including advantages and disadvantages for each. With that overview the team shall choose which map representation makes most sense for to implement during the mapping assignments. \par
Note: \emph{the focus should be on mobile robots moving in a 2D space using information from a range-finder.}
